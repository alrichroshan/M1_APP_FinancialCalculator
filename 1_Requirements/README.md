# State of Art
| Time | Features | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| 2500BC | Abacus - which was used for simple addition and subtraction | It was handmade and cheaper, but less efficient |
| 1642 | Pascal calculator - which could be perform all the basic arithmetic operation but difficult to produce | The device was complex , expensive and rare |
| 1860 | Mechanical Calculator – which was easier to produce but was bulkier and hard to carry | The device was expensive but less complex |
| 1945 | Mechanical Handheld calculator easier to produce and lighter | The device is cheaper than bulk mechanical calculator |
| 1970 | Introduction of Digital pocket calculator | The device is very cheap and easy to use |
| 1995 | Multiuse calculator began to replace the single use calculator and provided more features | Cheap calculators with multiple features is widely used today |
| 2001 | Smartphones and desktop now comes with sophisticated inbuilt calculators | Inbuilt powerful calculator comes free with smartphones and desktops |
